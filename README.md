# Credit Risk Modeling using Machine Learning

## Aim:
This isnâ€™t just another data projectâ€”itâ€™s a blueprint for risk domination. Weâ€™re tearing through the dataset, uncovering insights that others overlook, and visualizing trends that redefine the game. Then, we bring in the heavy artillery: supervised machine learning models that donâ€™t just predict riskâ€”they call the shots.

Weâ€™re locking in:
ðŸ”¥ Probability of Default (PD) â€“ Spotting bad loans before they happen.
ðŸ”¥ Loss Given Default (LGD) â€“ Calculating how much is at stake before itâ€™s too late.
ðŸ”¥ Exposure at Default (EAD) â€“ Knowing exactly how deep the risk goes.

This isnâ€™t about predicting the futureâ€”itâ€™s about owning it.

## Dataset:
Weâ€™re working with real financial firepowerâ€”a dataset packing over 800,000 consumer loans issued between 2007 and 2015 by Lending Club, a heavyweight in the US peer-to-peer lending game.

Thereâ€™s more than one version of this dataset floating around, but hereâ€™s the deal: we cut through the noise, extract what matters, and turn raw numbers into strategic intelligence

## Models:
* For PD, I have used logistic regression
* For LGD, There is two stage approach. 1) Logistic Regression and 2) Linear Regression
* For EAD, I have trained linear regression

## Tools: pandas, scikit-learn, plotly, Flask
## Credit
I have gained all the knowledge through a course i.e https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-risk-modeling-in-python/
